# jkfso-haskell

To run program when using Haskero:
1. Have Haskero plug-in installed on Visual Studio Code.
2. In root project folder, compile with: `stack build`
3. Run executable with: `stack exec jkfso-haskell-exe <inputfile> <outputfile>`

If Haskero has error in output tab when opening Visual Studio Code, try closing and opening VS Code again. Usually starts Haskero after that.
